<blockquote>
	<p>The beet is the most intense of vegetables. The
radish, admittedly, is more feverish, but the fire of
the radish is a cold fire, the fire of discontent not of
passion. Tomatoes are lusty enough, yet there runs
through tomatoes an undercurrent of frivolity.
Beets are deadly serious</p>
